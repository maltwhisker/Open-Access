This code contains a large amount of work that is commented out. This is due to an unknown environment/conflict error
that stopped me from progressing any further within the allotted timeframe. I am confident that it can be resolved in
the not too distant future, and hope to have fully functional source code available as soon as that day comes. 

This code does still run and displays a processed version of Google Street view. 

By pressing the spacebar the location will be randomized, and navigation is controlled with the mouse (clicking/movement).

The only addons required for this to run (in it's current state) are:

- ofxAwesomiumPlus
- ofxPostProcessing

In the future it will also require:

- ofxOsc
- ofxOpenCv

Tested and built with OF version 0.9.3
